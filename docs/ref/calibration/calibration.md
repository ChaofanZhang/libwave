## Introduction

Calibration is essential for correctly interpreting sensor data in a common reference frame.  It is comprises of two components, intrinsic calibration of each sensor, and extrinsic calibration between sensors.  The intrisic calibration seeks to accurately relate a measurement to an observed object in the sensor coordinate frame, while extrinsic calibration seeks to transform the sensor frame into a common reference frame, be it another sensor frame or a vehicle fixed frame.  Calibration ultimately tries to find an optimal set of static parameters that define a measurement model to be used with all measurements from a particular sensor.
